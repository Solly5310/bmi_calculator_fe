# Overview:
Initial scope for backend:

* Build frontend for a web page that accepts height and weight of a person, and calculates their BMI (Body Mass Index).
* The fronted should be built in React. It should allow the user to enter height and weight in metric (cm, kg) or US units (ft/inches, pounds).

* The frontend will submit a request to the backend endpoint, the request should include the height and weight entered by the user, and the backend will return a response containing the BMI value.
* The calculation of the BMI should happen in the backend, not in the React app. 
* Make a repository for the frontend and for the backend (you can put both in one repository, or you can use 2 separate repositories, one for frontend web app and one for backend).
* Make the repository public and share the URL so we can access it.

# Further steps:
- Deploy on aws
- Add MongoDB backend to record weight entries
- (both are contigent on creating frontend as well)


# Operations Instructions:
- Download zip file and decompress folder
- Open your IDE and open the root folder
- Enter npm install in terminal
- Once all dependencies are installed, enter npm start in terminal
- The frontend will then be working, simply download the frontend and follow steps listed in its read me:
